# save_all
This script is an official QGIS plugin. It can be found on the official plugin repository here: https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SaveAllScript/

I made this script to help me and some colleagues save time when saving files, so I hope that it can be useful to you as well.

While the script was developed for version 3.30 â€˜s-Hertogenbosch, it also works in 3.32 Lima. The script has also been successfully used in version 3.16 Hanover, but it is not guaranteed to work in all other versions prior to 3.30.
If there are prior versions that also work, please let me know, and I can update this list for others.
