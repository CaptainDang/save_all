name=Save All
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Save all workaround mainly intended for windows, as windows has unusual file saving behavior. This plugin saves the qgis project file and all vector and raster layers into a user specified folder. All styles and formatting are saved with each layer, ensuring that they are opened up with the proper style the next time the project is opened.
version=0.1

about=Save All is meant to be an improved version of the normal save feature because it also saves all temporary layers as permanent layers automatically. Additionally, when the plugin is run, the user is prompted for a location where they would like to save a new folder. Then, another prompt asks the user what they would like to name the project and it's container folder. Lastly, all vector and raster layers are saved into the folder, along with the QGIS project file itself. Each time the user uses this plugin, if they use the exact same folder name in the second prompt, the plugin will overwrite the previous save of the project in that folder, something that is not natively possible when considering a mix of permanent and temporary layers.
